AI-Based Smart Healthcare Assistant
This project is a smart healthcare assistant designed to improve healthcare delivery by assisting patients with medical advice, appointment scheduling, and record management. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, the assistant analyzes patient symptoms, predicts possible medical conditions, and provides healthcare recommendations. It also streamlines appointment scheduling and manages patient records, allowing for a more efficient and accessible healthcare experience.

Features
Medical Condition Prediction: Uses NLP and an LSTM model to classify medical conditions based on symptoms provided by the patient.
Medical Advice and Recommendations: Provides condition-specific advice sourced from a predefined dictionary of common medical recommendations.
Appointment Scheduling: Enables patients to schedule appointments with specialized doctors and checks for availability to prevent conflicts.
Patient Record Management: Stores patient information such as demographics, medical history, and appointments in a structured format for easy retrieval.
Data Analysis and Response Accuracy Tracking: Tracks model accuracy in symptom classification and measures average response time for user queries.
Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of 2,000 medical records, containing columns for:

Name: Patient's name
Age: Patient's age
Gender: Patient's gender
Doctor: Assigned doctor
Appointment Time: Scheduled time for the appointment
Date of Admission: Date of the patient's admission
Medical Condition: Recorded medical condition of the patient
The Dataset used is:
